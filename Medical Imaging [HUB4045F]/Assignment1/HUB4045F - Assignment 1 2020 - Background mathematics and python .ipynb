    "### Instructions :\n",
    "- Solutions to be submitted as a Jupyter notebook called \"__HUB4045F - Yourname - Your student number\"__.\n",
    "- Explanations to questions should be done in formatted markdown cells. Code should be presented in code cells. \n",
    "- All required libraries for your code to run should be clearly stated at the beginning of the notebook with full instructions of how to install them.\n",
    "- All code should be well commented.\n",
    "- Part marks will be given for non running code provided that an explanation is provided for why the code is not working.\n",
    "- Add appropriate references to other peoples work or code. \n",
    "- Please use relative paths for any images, videos you embed and of course you will need to upload them with your python file when submitting. Please zip the full list of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NB We will submit the code for similarity tests (http://www.tareeinternet.com/scripts/comparison-tool/). As much as we encourage sharing ideas and working together its important that the final submission be individual work."
